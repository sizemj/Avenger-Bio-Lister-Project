# Avenger-Bio-Lister-Project

Lists Avenger team member's short bios from SuperHeros API

This is my project for Code Louisville C#. It pulls in short bios/descriptions from [SuperHero API](https://superheroapi.com/).

This is a menu bases console application that list short bio of members of the Avengers  
Bios will come from the SuperHeros API
Menu will be number based (option 1 gives you Captain America etc)
Menu will have an exit function

### Characters I will use:

- Ant-Man
- Black Panther
- Black Widow
- Captain America
- Falcon
- Hawkeye
- Hulk
- Iron Man
- Scarlet Witch
- Spider-Man (Peter Parker)
- Thor
- Vision

### Information on characters I will list

- Name
- Description (this is a short bio)
- Number of comic books of this character has been in.

  **Note: I would like to use more characters but not all of them have a bio from the API (no bios for Black Window, Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man)**

## Features from the feature list per project requirements I will use:

- Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program

- Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app

- Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent

- Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

- Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file

- Create 3 or more unit tests for your application (XUnit)

## All API information is pulled from the [SuperHero API](https://superheroapi.com/)
